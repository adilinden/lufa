##LUFA - The Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs

Forked from [abcminiuser/lufa](https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa) to use as submodule in [adilinden/uino-arduino](https://github.com/adilinden/uino-arduino).  In particular I wanted to add additional tags to easily access the older LUFA releases used by the various USB firmwares and bootloaders.

Please see the authors [README.txt](https://github.com/adilinden/lufa/blob/master/README.txt) for further details.

This package contains the complete LUFA library, demos, user-submitted
projects and bootloaders for use with compatible microcontroller models.
LUFA is a simple to use, lightweight framework which sits atop the hardware
USB controller in specific AVR microcontroller models, and allows for the
quick and easy creation of complex USB devices and hosts.
